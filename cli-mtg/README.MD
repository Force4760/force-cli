# I'm not working in this cli app anymore. I'm building a similar discord bot so maybe one day I will reopen this and make this a cli version of the bot. If you want to use this you are free to use it and mod it to you delight. 

# MTG CLI
Are you a MTG (Magic: the Gathering) lover like me?

If your answer is **YES** then you will like this app.

## What is MTG 
MTG is a *tcg* (trading card game) created in 1993 by Richard Garfield.
MTG was the first game of it's kind, being often called the best card game ever.

The game is a combination of *poker* and *chess*, where players build a deck of cards (60 in most formats) and battle each other.

## What is this CLI 
**I'm still developing it's early version so I don't know exactly what it will be able to do**

**For now it's a card search and deck building tool**
